# Basic Informational Site
## About
This was my implementation of the [Basic Informational Site](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-basic-informational-site) for The Odin Project's [Introduction To NodeJS](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/nodejs#introduction-to-nodejs). The site contains no styling and was simply an opportunity to practice setting up a basic webserver that served different pages according to the URL.
<br/><br/>
Update: This project was rewritten using express to achieve the same result of setting up a web server.
